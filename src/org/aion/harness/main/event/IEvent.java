/**
 * An event is fundamentally a String (called the "event string", and
 * an event is "satisfied" (or rather, the event has occurred) when the
 * event string has been discovered in some line. The typical use case is
 * determining whether the event string has been discovered in a file,
 * like a log file.
 *
 * However, events can be strung together into complex logic using the
 * basic AND and OR operators so that the event has now effectively
 * become a conditional string. This allows for arbitrarily complex logic
 * to be embedded into a single event, which an outside observer interacts
 * with only by asking the event whether it has been satisfied (whether its
 * conditional logic evaluates to {@code true}) by some incoming String.
 * The outside observer needs know nothing about how complex the underlying
 * event is, but only whether or not the event has been observed (satisfied).
 *
 * At any point, the "satisfied" strings of the event can be queried. This
 * will produce all underlying event strings that exist in the conditional
 * logic such that they have been satisfied (observed). Therefore, once an
 * event is satisfied, all of the underlying strings that were observed and
 * contributed to its satisfaction can be queried and examined.
 *
 * Once an event is satisfied it cannot be "re-satisfied". Consider the case
 * of a logical-or, in which only one of the two conditions need be satisfied.
 * If one condition is satisfied and the other is not then the event is
 * determined to be satisfied. If this same event is later fed a new string
 * that would count as satisfying the other still unsatisfied string, then
 * this new information is ignored and the exact same state persists.
 *
 * Therefore once an event is satisfied, the conditions which originally
 * satisfied it will be made immutable.
 *
 * It is possible for a logical-or to have both of its components satisfied,
 * since an incoming string may satisfy multiple event strings at once. There
 * is no "precedence of satisfaction".
 *
 * All classes implementing this interface should satisfy the following two
 * immutability requirements:
 *
 *   1. The event string is immutable.
 *   2. Once an event is satisfied, its entire state must become immutable.
