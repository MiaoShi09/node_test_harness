/**
 * The result of a request for some log event to be observed.
 *
 * A log event result can be in 1 of 4 possible states:
 *   - The event has been observed: indicates the event occurred.
 *   - The event was not observed: indicates the node shutdown before the event was witnessed.
 *   - The event was rejected: indicates that observation at the time of the request was not possible.
 *   - The event was expired: indicates that the event timed out before being satisfied.
 *
 * In the case of an event being observed, it will also come with a timestamp indicating when the
 * listener observed the event.
 *
 * In the case of an event being rejected, it will also come with a reason for why the event request
 * was rejected.
 *
 * There is not concept of equality defined for a log event result.
 *
 * A log event result is immutable.
