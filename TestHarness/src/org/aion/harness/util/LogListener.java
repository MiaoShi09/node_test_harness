/**
 * A listener that "tails" the output log of a node and processes every line in that log one by one
 * to determine if any threads have submitted a request for an event string to be observed and
 * whether this current line satisfies any of those requested events.
 *
 * A log listener maintains a pool of pending requests. Each request is an {@link IEvent} object,
 * and is therefore a conditional request for certain substrings to be witnessed in the log file.
 *
 * Each time this listener receives a new line in the log, it checks each of the requests and
 * attempts to satisfy their logic.
 *
 * Requests can be in 1 of 5 states: pending, satisfied, unobserved, expired, rejected.
 *
 * All requests enter the pool in the pending state. Once they move out of the pending state this
 * listener has the right to remove them from the pool.
 *
 * If a request is observed then it is marked satisfied.
 *
 * If the node shuts down then all pending requests in the pool will be marked unobserved.
 *
 * If a request times out it is marked expired.
 *
 * If the listener gets into a fatal state, if it is not currently listening to a log file, if it
 * stops listening to a log file, or if the requester receives an interrupt signal while the request
 * is in the pool, then it will be marked as rejected.
 *
 * This class is thread-safe.
